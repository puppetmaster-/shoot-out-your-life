# Rust
This is my first public rust project.

I started programming in rust in February 2019 and had no previous experience with other system programming languages.

If you see something that could be done (better/simpler/more rust like), I would be very happy if you could create an issue or a pull request.

*You can only learn from mistakes, if you don't do any then there is nothing to learn from.*

# Game Engine
As game engine I used [Tetra][TETRA] and highly recommend it.

# Play
If you'd like to try the game, you can download it from my [itch.io][GAMEPAGE] page.
